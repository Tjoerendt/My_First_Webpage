    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a college student at Ivy Tech Community College, currently heading into my junior year.
    I'm exploring the world of web development and building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    I enjoy learning how websites work and bringing creative ideas to life online.</p>
    <p>This portfolio is part of my journey — a space where I can share my progress, projects, and what I’ve learned along the way.
    As I continue my education and grow my skills, I hope to pursue a career in tech and create tools that help people.</p>
